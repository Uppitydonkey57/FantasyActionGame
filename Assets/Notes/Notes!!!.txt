Game Foundation:
A zelda-like RPG that has a silly story and with a lot of weird nonsense


Bugs:

weird offset with mouse (probably just add an offset in the aiming)

world space canvases appearing inside of other objects

Feature Creep:
hats
pets
weapons with knockback modifiers (more knockback more fun!!!)
breakeables

Marketing:

    Twitter:
        intially show what the game is
        every gameplay related post should show something new and interesting
        otherwise it can be something people can learn from with the game engine side
        or a funny thing to catch peoples attention
        announcement would work to

Story Ideas!

Big Story
    
    Idea 1
        You were part of a cult which opened a portal to a realm of evil tyrants. you attempt to stop the
        ritual but you mess it up even more and create holes in the universe which lots of random things come
        through corrupting the world

Little Story

    Idea 1
        For reasons indifferent to you a series of portals opened around the world which corrupted the world
        For a currently undecided reason you decide it is your duty to save as much as you can so you go around
        attempting to close portals.


Area Ideas
Desert (Dune themed)
Dinosaur Island 
Forest 
Dwarf Mountain Home
Ice Place
Underwater
Space Tyrant Home

Country area 
	Rock People
	Mine for fantasy material


Quest Systems:
Quest Giver 
Goal
Reward
Dialogue

Quest List will be checked when: enemy is killed? item is obtained
Change quest list dialogue identifier to a custom key as opposed to quest name

Area Design Plan!
Think of a basis for the idea
block out the area
put in important stuff (ie enemies, quests, town stuff)
big details
make new art
little detail

original texture resolution is 513 by 513

Change ArmorManager Name To EquipmentManager

when an enemy is killeed

Serialization:

    Items:
        list of identifiers which can be determined by item name (sure hope I don't end up with 2 items with the same name)

    Quests:
        json list each with an element with the name to identify the data and then a 1+ 
        strings which can be translated to figure out quest progress

    Player: 
        scene
        position
            

Canvas UI Discord Comment

Could have the individual buttons separated out and rendered to separate render textures, then have mouse detection on the render texture; 
but at that point suppose you could just have a normal texture and skip the canvas element for buttons

STORY IDEA

    THE PLAYER HAS A SPECIAL TOOL THAT ALLOWS HIM TO SEAL PORTALS ONCE HE FINDS THEIR SOURCE.
