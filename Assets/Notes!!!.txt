Bugs:

weird offset with mouse (probably just add an offset in the aiming)

Feature Creep:
hats
pets
weapons with knockback modifiers (more knockback more fun!!!)

Marketing:

    Twitter:
        intially show what the game is
        every gameplay related post should show something new and interesting
        otherwise it can be something people can learn from with the game engine side
        or a funny thing to catch peoples attention
        announcement would work to

Story Ideas!

Big Story
    
    Idea 1
        You were part of a cult which opened a portal to a realm of evil tyrants. you attempt to stop the
        ritual but you mess it up even more and create holes in the universe which lots of random things come
        through corrupting the world

Little Story

    Idea 1
        For reasons indifferent to you a series of portals opened around the world which corrupted the world
        For a currently undecided reason you decide it is your duty to save as much as you can so you go around
        attempting to close portals.
