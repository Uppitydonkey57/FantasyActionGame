Bugs:

weird offset with mouse (probably just add an offset in the aiming)

Feature Creep:
hats
pets
weapons with knockback modifiers (more knockback more fun!!!)

Wizard types:
    teleport, shoot, teleport: terraria, shovel knight, my last game
    move, shoot, teleport: most other games

Marketing:

    Twitter:
        intially show what the game is
        every gameplay related post should show something new and interesting
        otherwise it can be something people can learn from with the game engine side
        or a funny thing to catch peoples attention
        announcement would work to
